I received my B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering (minor in Economics) from National Taiwan University in 2012 and my PhD degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Cornell University in 2018. Before Meta, I was a postdoctoral scholar research associate at California Institute of Technology from 2018 to 2021.",		"home-research-interests": "Research Interests",	"home-research-interests-network": "<b>Computer networking:</b> system optimization and algorithm design",	"description-network": "A networked system consists of computation and storage resources, and it is critical for the network operator to utilize the resources efficiently. My research focuses on the following questions:<ul><li>How can we optimize the system performance using network resources?</li><li>What is the optimal performance (or the performance limit) of the system given the underlying resource configurations? What are the bottlenecked resources and how to further improve the system performance?</li></ul>",	"home-research-interests-control": "<b>Control theory:</b> controller synthesis and deployment architecture",	"description-control": "To control large-scale networked cyber-physical systems (CPSs), we need to synthesize a controller that respects the communication limitations and deploy the controller down to the CPS. My research focuses on the following questions:<ul><li>How to acquire the networked controller (as mathematical models) systematically and efficiently?</li><li>How to generate the corresponding cyber-physical structures (architectures) that can be implemented in the system, and what trade-off will we face beyond optimality?</li></ul>"}
